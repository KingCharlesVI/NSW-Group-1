      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
      This is a hardcore/realism unit. Operations and Training are taken extremely seriously, there is significant planning involved in Training & Operations. The unit has a laidback group of members outside of Training & Operations. The individuals who graduate are all like minded, and it's a tight-knit community.

Everyone has to earn their positions. Dedication to the unit, and hard work is how our members become leaders. We strongly believe in evolution, and are always looking to expand and improve our training.

We operate our Units as closely to real-life as possible within the constraints of ARMA, we will simulate anything that can increase realism, improve gameplay, or increase complexity of operations (we want a challenge). If you have any questions about the culture of the unit, or the type of people in it, ask in our Discord Server.
